## How it Works ?
Using DaVinci 002 API of the GPT-3 model, we summarize articles of about 4000 tokens.  
We use Flask web framework with HTML to create a website to implement this.  
The user can choose from creative to very objective and the summary generated is based on that choice; these are obtained by tweaking the temperature and max _tokens values.
